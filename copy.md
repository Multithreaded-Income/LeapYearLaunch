# Leap Year Launch

> The universe has gifted you an extra day this year.  Use it to launch something new.

Did you have a new years resolution to do something new this year?  

Maybe launch a new course?  Launch your FIRST course?

Maybe you wanted to start a YouTube channel, and start talking about all the topics you discuss with yourself in the shower?

Have you been toying around with your idea for a new "Facebook for People Who Love Poodles" app?


## The First Step Is The Hardest

What's stopping you from starting any of these ideas?

It could be FEAR. It's a lot of work to start something new.  It's daunting to think about the shear amount of time and effort necessary to build something new.  

It could be TIME. 

It could be LACK OF KNOWLEDGE.
